* [API (GraphQL)](~/lib/graphqlapi/getting-started.md) - for adding a GraphQL endpoint to your app
* [API (REST)](~/lib/restapi/getting-started.md) - for adding a REST endpoint to your app
* [Authentication](~/lib/auth/getting-started.md) - for managing your users
* [DataStore](~/lib/datastore/getting-started.md) - for making it easier to program for a distributed data store for offline and online scenarios
* [Predictions](~/lib/predictions/getting-started.md) - to detect text, images, and more!
* [Storage](~/lib/storage/getting-started.md) - store complex objects like pictures and videos to the cloud.
